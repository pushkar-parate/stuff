# **stuff**

A growing collection of my resources, notes, and code experiments across programming languages and core IT concepts.  
Everything here is **work-in-progress** — this repo is where I learn, break things, and build foundations.

## **What’s Inside**
- Notes on languages I'm studying  
- Small code snippets & experiments  
- IT concepts and reference material  
- Random technical explorations  

## **Status**
🚧 **Early stage. Constantly changing. Incomplete by design.**  
This is my sandbox for learning and improving fast.

## **Respect the Work**
Please **do not copy, repost, or claim anything in this repo as your own**.  
You’re welcome to learn from it, but **don’t steal it** or present it as original work.
